My name is Hammond. This is me when I gave a speech on a stage!

![Input Port]({{ 'assets/img/aboutme/Hammond-Pearce-speech.jpg' | relative_url }}){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

I have a Ph.D. in Computer Systems Engineering, with a focus on time-predictable systems and formally proving safety. Currently I work as a postdoctoral researcher in cybersecurity for embedded systems and additive manufacturing - [Hammond's Academic Website Link](https://www.cyberhammond.com/).

I've worked at a variety of cool places, including:
* NYU Center for Cybersecurity ([my current job!](https://cyber.nyu.edu/profile/hammond-pearce/))
* NASA Ames (internship with the Intelligent Robotics Group)
* The University of Auckland Department of Electrical, Computer, and Software Engineering (tutor, technician, professional teaching fellow)
* Enertec Marine (contractor)
* ThreeTwoOne (software developer)
* Vend (support engineer)

### Amazon affiliate notice

Occasionally I put Amazon affiliate links on this website (at some point I'll probably blog about how I set this up). 
If a link is an affiliate link I always put a note next to the link acknowledging this, and it's a requirement of the program that I state somewhere on the website that "As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.". 
There's no requirement to use my links if I have linked to a purchase you'd like to buy, and I'll always encourage you to shop around to find the best deals!
But for me, the Amazon affiliate program means I have zero motivation to put ads anywhere on this site, so it's something, right?
