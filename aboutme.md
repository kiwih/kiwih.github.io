My name is Hammond. This is me when I gave a speech on a stage!

I have a Ph.D. in Computer Systems Engineering, with a focus on time-predictable systems and formally proving safety.

I've worked at a variety of cool places, including:
* NASA Ames (internship with the Intelligent Robotics Group)
* The University of Auckland Department of Electrical, Computer, and Software Engineering (tutor, technician, professional teaching fellow)
* Enertec Marine (contractor)
* ThreeTwoOne (software developer)
* Vend (support engineer)
